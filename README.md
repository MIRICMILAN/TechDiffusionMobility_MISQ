# Technology Diffusion, Human Capital, and Employee Mobility

## Abstract

As new technologies diffuse within an industry, they impact the value of worker skills, and in turn may influence the mobility of workers between firms in that industry. This mobility may be particularly pronounced for individuals whose jobs are complementary to these new technologies and therefore increases demand for these individuals. In this paper, we investigate the impact of a small set of development tools diffusing within an industry and investigate whether this was associated with an increase in worker mobility for individuals with complementary skills, compared to those with (partly) substitutable ones. Specifically, we study the diffusion of middleware tools within the video game industry that made human capital more general by making it industry-specific (rather than firm-specific), and was complementary to the tasks being performed by Creatives in this industry, compared to Programmers. We exploit the uneven diffusion of these tools across genres to investigate whether workers experienced greater mobility in the genre where the technologies diffused more broadly. We also find greater mobility between projects that used the same middleware components. We find that the diffusion of these tools was associated with greater mobility for creatives than for programmers. These results are robust to a variety of empirical checks and speak to the impact of broad diffusion of IT tools, which may enable workers to more easily move between companies.

## Summary of Results

This study examines how the diffusion of middleware technology in the video game industry affects the mobility of high-skilled workers. We find that the adoption of middleware is associated with distinct mobility patterns for different types of human capital.

### 1. Technology Diffusion
Middleware usage increased significantly during the sample period, particularly after 2002. The figure below illustrates the rising share of game titles utilizing third-party middleware components.

### 2. Mobility Patterns
Our baseline regression analysis reveals a differential impact on worker mobility based on their role. The marginal effects plots below show the predicted likelihood of a worker changing employers, comparing those who worked on projects with middleware versus those who did not, stratified by game genre (Shooter vs. Non-Shooter).

**Programmers vs. Creatives**
For **Programmers** (left panels), working with middleware is associated with a lower likelihood of mobility, consistent with the standardization of technical skills. Conversely, for **Creatives** (right panels), middleware usage is associated with higher mobility, suggesting that these tools allow their specialized artistic skills to be more easily transferred across firms.
