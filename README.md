## Summary of Results

This study examines how the diffusion of middleware technology in the video game industry affects the mobility of high-skilled workers. We find that the adoption of middleware is associated with distinct mobility patterns for different types of human capital.

### 1. Technology Diffusion
Middleware usage increased significantly during the sample period, particularly after 2002. The figure below illustrates the rising share of game titles utilizing third-party middleware components.

### 2. Mobility Patterns
Our baseline regression analysis reveals a differential impact on worker mobility based on their role. The marginal effects plots below show the predicted likelihood of a worker changing employers, comparing those who worked on projects with middleware versus those who did not, stratified by game genre (Shooter vs. Non-Shooter).

**Programmers vs. Creatives**
For **Programmers** (left panels), working with middleware is associated with a lower likelihood of mobility, consistent with the standardization of technical skills. Conversely, for **Creatives** (right panels), middleware usage is associated with higher mobility, suggesting that these tools allow their specialized artistic skills to be more easily transferred across firms.
